#### ðŸš¨ Please note that the main branch is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, so it is vital to avoid pushing directly to the `main` branch. Only through the Pull Request process will changes be properly tested and deployed

This DOCUMENT provides guidance on how to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the master branch of our project repository. Please follow these steps to ensure a smooth and collaborative code review process.
 
#### Pull Request Process

## Guidelines

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local development environment using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Raisul-24/home-page-design.git
   ```
2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch locally to work on your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
3. **Make the Desired Changes:** Make the necessary code modifications and ensure that your changes align with the project's guidelines and standards.
4. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
5. **Push Changes to Your Branch:** Push your changes to the repository:
   ```
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request:** Open a new Pull Request.
7. **Add Reviewers:** Assign one or more reviewers to your Pull Request by mentioning their GitHub handles in the PR description or using the GitHub interface.
8. **Address Feedback:** If reviewers provide feedback, make the necessary changes to your code and push the updates to your branch. The Pull Request will automatically update.
9. **Code Review and Approval:** Reviewers will thoroughly examine your code, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and eventually approve the changes if everything meets the project's requirements.
10. **Merge into Master:** Once your Pull Request is approved, a project maintainer will handle merging your changes into the master branch. **Do not merge your own Pull Requests.**

Thank you for contributing to our project! Your adherence to this Pull Request process ensures a smooth and collaborative development environment. 
Happy coding!ðŸ™Œ
